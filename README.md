Life Saver is a quiz that educates user on what to do when they witness a cardiac arrest. A cardiac arrest is when a person's heart stops pumping blood around their body and they stop breathing. Without immediate treatment or medical attention, the person will die. If you see someone having a cardiac arrest, phone 999 immediately and start CPR.

# UX
## User Goals
- Get the user to learn the sequential steps needed to help someone who is having a cardiac arrest in public e.g train station, supermaket etc
- Get the user to understand that cardiac arrest can happen anywhere and at anytime and that everyone should know how to perform CPR

## User Stories
- I want the user to feel equipped and informed on what steps to take when they witness someone unconcious in public.
- I want the user to see their progress as they take the quiz.
- I expect the user to complete the game and watch the video at the end. There is no fail in the game, its either pass or quit. A wrong answer will restart the game and give users an opportunity to play again.

## Requirements
- A mobile device or computer that has connection to the internet

# Design

## Colours
- I have used [Colours.co](https://coolors.co/) to create a good contrast on the page as well as choosing appopriate colour palette.
- The predominant colours used are dark red (#6B0000) and white (#fbfbff). Blue (#00358b) and green (#006b35) were used as an assent colours when buttons and some elements are hovered upon.

## Fonts
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) was used to obtain text font that best fit the website. Oswald and Lato were employed for this purpose.

## Icons and logo
- The two font used in the site was supplied from [Font Awesome library](https://fontawesome.com/). One font was for the logo and the second was for the footer.

# PRESENT LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE IMPROVEMENT

- Due to lack of time and concerns about not meeting submition deadline, some improvements are needed to scale the project further. 
- The idea for the project as of now is for users to go through each questions without using the nextstep or back button. For now these button should be used to review the questions and understand the steps needed to help someone who is having cardiac arrest.
