Life Saver is a quiz that educates user on what to do when they witness a cardiac arrest. A cardiac arrest is when a person's heart stops pumping blood around their body and they stop breathing. Without immediate treatment or medical attention, the person will die. If you see someone having a cardiac arrest, phone 999 immediately and start CPR.

# UX
## User Goals
- Get the user to learn the sequential steps needed to help someone who is having a cardiac arrest in public e.g train station, supermaket etc
- Get the user to understand that cardiac arrest can happen anywhere and at anytime and that everyone should know how to perform CPR

## User Stories
- I want the user to feel equipped and informed on what steps to take when they witness someone unconcious in public.
- I want the user to see their progress as they take the quiz.
- I expect the user to complete the game and watch the video at the end. There is no fail in the game, its either pass or quit. A wrong answer will restart the game and give users an opportunity to play again.

## Requirements
